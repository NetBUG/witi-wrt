# MQMaker WiTi repo
This is a repository originally cloned from [https://github.com/mqmaker/openwrt/](https://github.com/mqmaker/openwrt/).
However, the author decided to purge his website and the repos, thus the current repo is not cloned from it.

I made a quick and presumably reliable build of it.

I am also planning to use MediaTek SDK-based branch of OpenWRT to try using second WAN port, but cannot guarantee any deadlines.

## Known issues
* Current distribution lacks certain packages, e.g. some Avahi dependencies fail to be installed
* Python3 has issues with `setuptools-scm` module, it's not advised to install anything depending on it
* WiTi only features 16 MB of Flash memory, it's not sufficient to put all packages on it.
Please also checkout [OpenWRT Wiki](https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/mqmaker/witi) related to the board.

# Distribution
I have made a tiny repository with [binary firmware for WiTi board](http://nb3.me/witi/) and a [repository of opkg packages](https://github.com/mqmaker/openwrt/) for it -- of course, not complete.
Please use the [LEDE repository](http://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/ramips/mt7621/packages) for any missing packages.

# Original message from OpenWRT project
This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

Please use "make menuconfig" to choose your preferred
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.
